    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound / 450g thinly sliced beef (ribeye or sirloin)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp vegetable oil (for cooking)</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp mirin (rice wine)</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp sesame oil</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tsp grated ginger</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp toasted sesame seeds</li>
        <li>2 green onions, chopped (for garnish)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a bowl, whisk together soy sauce, brown sugar, mirin, sesame oil, minced garlic, and grated ginger to create the marinade.</li>
        <li>Place the thinly sliced beef in a shallow dish or a resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over the beef, making sure all slices are well coated. Allow it to marinate for at least 30 minutes to an hour. For a more intense flavor, marinate longer, even overnight in the refrigerator.</li>
        <li>Heat a skillet or a grill pan over medium-high heat. Add vegetable oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li>Remove the beef from the marinade, letting excess marinade drip off, and place it on the hot skillet or grill pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes per side until the beef is cooked through and slightly caramelized.</li>
        <li>While cooking, you can sprinkle some of the toasted sesame seeds on the beef for extra flavor and crunch.</li>
        <li>Once cooked, transfer the Bulgogi to a serving dish and garnish with chopped green onions and additional sesame seeds</li>
        <li>Serve the Bulgogi with steamed rice and side dishes like Kimchi and pickled vegetables. You can also wrap the Bulgogi in lettuce leaves for a delicious and refreshing "ssam" experience.</li>
    </ol>
