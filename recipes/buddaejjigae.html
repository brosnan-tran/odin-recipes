    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>

Originating during times of food scarcity, this stew creatively combines ingredients like sliced sausages, Spam or ham, tofu, kimchi, and other savory components. These elements are brought together in a spicy and hearty broth, enriched with the distinct flavors of gochugaru (Korean red pepper flakes), gochujang (Korean red pepper paste), and other seasonings. The result is a comforting and satisfying stew that symbolizes Korea's resourceful culinary evolution and brings together an assortment of tastes, textures, and histories in a single pot.
