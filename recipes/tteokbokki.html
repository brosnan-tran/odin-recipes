        <li>3 Tbsp gochujang (Korean chili paste)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 Tbsp raw sugar</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>

        <li>1 stalk green onion, finely chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Unless your rice cakes are soft already, soak them in warm water for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>
            Boil soup stock in a shallow pot over medium high head and dissolve the tteokbokki sauce by stirring it with a spatula.
            Once the seasoned stock is boiling, add the rice cakes, fish cakes, and onion. Boil them a further 3 to 5 minutes until 
            the rice cakes are fully cooked. Then, to thicken the sauce and to deepen the flavor, simmer it over low head for a further 
            2 to 4 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Add the sesame oil, sesame seeds, and green onion then quickly stir. Serve warm.</li>
