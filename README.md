# odin-recipes

This project is a basic website coded with HTML which links to several pages on my website displaying different Korean recipes. I will have demonstrated that I am proficient in using basic HTML elements such as paragraphs, headers, anchors, ordered/unordered lists and images.

Reflection: Completed the entire website without staging and committing when completing small tasks. Forgot to do so and will focus on doing so on the next project. Ended up staging and committing the entire project in one go.
