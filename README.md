# odin-recipes

Basic website coded with HTML which displays different Korean recipes. Practiced using basic HTML elements such as  paragraphs, headers, anchors, ordered/unordered lists and images.

Reflection 1: Completed the entire website without staging and committing when completing small tasks. Forgot to do so and will focus on doing so on the next project. Ended up staging and committing the entire project in one go.

Reflection 2: When adding styles.css, made sure to do multiple stagings and commits for both features and for bug fixes.
